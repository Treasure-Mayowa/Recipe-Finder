        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <h4>Recipe Finder was created to help tackle the issue of food waste. Food waste is a significant
            problem that is contributing to Climate Change. This waste ends up pile that release greenhouse
            gases. After in-depth research, I discovered that helping household know what to eat with their 
            available food materials would help reduce the throwing out of these materials and most importantly
            food waste.
